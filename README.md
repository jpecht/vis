## Description
This repository holds the code used to build my personal website of my collection of data visualizations. I have been adding to this collection periodically since 2014! Each data visualization is contained in its own file. All visualizations use [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) in some way.

### Notes
Recently (in 2019), I decided to switch to hosting these visualizations in a Vue framework. The code without the Vue framework still lives in this [vis-old](https://github.com/jpecht/vis-old) repository. I moved the code for each visualization to this repository anyway just for preservation's sake.
