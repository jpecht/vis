    postDescription: '<p>You can see vague horizontal lines around the more popular BPMs (128, 130, 140, 150, and 160). The line is especially prominent in 2011-2014 around 140 BPM mark, probably due to the big rise in dubstep around that time. The blob in the beginning of 2011 around the 125-132 BPM range shows my discovery of progressive house. And near the end of the timeline, you can see I get more interested in the 150 BPM trap-style songs.</p><p>I\'m pretty sure I started collecting around 2005, but I think when I changed computers mid-2010, a lot of songs picked up that 2010 upload date, hence the thick line there. You can also see when I was computer-less for a couple months in 2015. And lastly, you can see I started downloading much more frequently starting mid-2016 when I moved to Boulder and started DJing more.</p>',
